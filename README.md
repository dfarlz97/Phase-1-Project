# Snake-Like Game V1

## Project Description
"The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult." 

## How to play
"You'll start each game with one green and one red square. The green square is your snake and the red is an apple. Move the snake around the screen and eat as many apples as you can until the screen is full of the snake's body. Each time an apple is eaten, the snake will grow."
